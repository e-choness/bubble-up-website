Dive into the fast-paced, Tetris-inspired world of Bubble UP!, a new arcade game now available to wishlist on Steam!

Match bubbles by color, pop groups to clear the screen, and create massive chain reactions to climb the leaderboards. With three unique events—Bubble Mania, Bubble Frenzy, and and Multibubble—that activate under different conditions, the game offers endless arcade action for arcade lovers and score chasers.

Developed by Sub Pixel Luck, Neal Wagram, and Beili (Echo) Yin, Bubble UP! is set to release in 2025. Don't miss your chance to be one of the first to dive in!
